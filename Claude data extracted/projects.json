Core Prompt Engineering Frameworks\nTo achieve \"intentional outputs,\" you must move beyond vague commands and provide deep context.\n\u2022 The SIEMP Framework: This foundational system consists of Situation (defining your specific role and background), Intention (highlighting the end goal), Specificity (the \"how\" and detailed constraints), Medium (the output format like tables or code boxes), and Prompt Iteration (refining based on memory).\n\u2022 The RGC Formula: Every high-quality prompt should assign a Role (persona), define a Goal (purpose), specify a Result (desired output), and provide Context (target audience and constraints).\n\u2022 The Mentor Approach: You should treat the AI like a mentor by under-thinking and over-explaining; providing minor details ensures the output is valuable rather than generic.\n2. Advanced Prompting Tactics\n\u2022 Reverse Prompting: You can clone any writing style by providing a sample and asking the AI to reverse engineer a prompt based on its tone, syntax, and language.\n\u2022 Chain of Thought: Asking the AI to \"explain its reasoning\" or \"think step by step\" helps it reach more accurate, logical conclusions.\n\u2022 Shift Terms: These are used to iterate on existing outputs without starting over, such as telling the AI to be \"more concise\" or to \"make the pain points more painful\".\n\u2022 Ask Before Answering: Instead of giving a command, tell the AI your task and instruct it to \"ask me questions first\" so it can gather the information needed for a perfect result.\n3. The Client Compass: Sales & Branding\nThe sources outline a method for dominating the \"digital economy\" as a freelancer or growth partner.\n\u2022 Next Gen Branding: Your social media is a modern business card; bios should highlight specific \"outcomes\" (e.g., \"Convert leads on autopilot\") rather than just listing skills.\n\u2022 Power Prospecting: Identify \"dream prospects\" who have an audience and a product but lack optimized marketing.\n\u2022 Automatic Funnel Hacking: Use AI to dissect a prospect's entire customer journey and generate a table of unique, high-value offers tailored to their specific business.\n\u2022 Objection Overturner: Create a \"Golden Prompt\" containing your offer and potential client objections; the AI then roleplays as the prospect to grade your performance and help you practice closing.\n4. AI Copywriting & Growth Systems\n\u2022 The PROOF System: Optimize any copy by ensuring it includes a Promise (main value), Results (proof points), Objections (handling concerns), Outcome (implementing the value), and Friction (risk reversals and clear CTAs).\n\u2022 Structure Engineering: Use proven templates like the QISDF structure (Question, Intrigue, Story, Discovery, Freebie) to ensure content flows logically toward a conversion.\n\u2022 Avoiding \"AI Slop\": You must clean out generic, robotic phrasing (e.g., \"discover,\" \"unlock,\" or large dashes) to prevent your work from being identified as AI-generated.\n5. Business Automation via Plugins\nPlugins act as a \"toolbox\" that allow the model to perform tasks beyond its native capabilities.\n\u2022 Webpilot: Summarises web content and writes articles from links.\n\u2022 Video Insights: Extracts transcripts and key takeaways from videos under one hour.\n\u2022 Speechki: Converts text into audio for podcasts or voiceovers.\n\u2022 Secondary Skills: Use AI as an Amplifier (improving existing work), an Assistant (automating outreach), or an Innovator (building entirely new AI-revolving services).\nAccording to the sources, Claude is specifically noted for its superior reasoning skills, use of analogies, and ability to write copy with a consistent brand voice compared to other models, though it may have a shorter memory for very large datasets.\n", "created_at": "2026-01-24T11:27:31.028352+00:00"}]}, {"uuid": "019c3384-5a5b-77c8-b1b6-a559342cbedf", "name": "Copywriting", "description": "Write high-converting copy and outreach for high-ticket clients.
