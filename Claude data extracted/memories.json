[{"conversations_memory": "**Work context**\n\nYehonatan is serving in the IDF with limited time availability while building an anonymous copywriting brand called Signal Lab (@signal.lab_). He positions himself as a \"revenue diagnostician\" who identifies where business funnels leak money, primarily targeting Hebrew-speaking coaches, course creators, and online businesses in Israel.\n\n**Personal context**\n\nYehonatan communicates fluently in both Hebrew and English, often switching between languages depending on context. He has a direct communication style and prefers actionable advice without theoretical explanations. He's also working on web development projects including an aquarium/fish store website.\n\n**Top of mind**\n\nYehonatan is actively developing fitness-related marketing materials, recently working on rewriting a fitness quiz and email sequence to incorporate details about an \"N&T\" (Nutrition & Training) program. He's also troubleshooting technical issues with his aquarium store website, including broken navigation for fish subcategories, missing product categories like food and accessories, and broken image links. These projects reflect his dual focus on both copywriting services and web development work.\n\n**Brief history**\n\n*Recent months*\n\nYehonatan developed a comprehensive client acquisition system that prioritizes outreach over content creation, allocating 70% of his time to direct outreach via DMs and email, 20% to content creation, and 10% to Upwork proposals. He created a systematic \"5-Step Conditional Free Value\" cold outreach methodology specifically for Israeli fitness and lifestyle coaches with 1K-50K followers, targeting 10%+ reply rates and 30%+ yes rates. The approach emphasizes selling specific problems rather than generic copywriting services, requiring genuine content consumption and personalized observations about prospects' business gaps. He uses AI tools like ChatGPT to streamline content production to approximately 30 minutes daily, planning 2-3 posts and reels weekly rather than daily posting, treating Instagram as a business card to support outreach rather than audience building. His service portfolio covers conversion audits, email marketing, landing pages, sales copy, and funnel fixes, with Hebrew outreach scripts using a bait-and-switch approach and anti-AI communication rules to maintain human-like messaging.", "project_memories": {"019bef8b-e828-72ce-8407-a15bf3b19e3d": "**Purpose & context**\n\nYehonatan is an active IDF soldier building Signal Lab, a revenue diagnostics business targeting Hebrew-speaking coaches, course creators, and digital businesses. His core value proposition focuses on finding and sealing specific revenue leaks in existing sales funnels rather than rebuilding entire systems. He positions himself around the concept of \"Minimum Viable Funnel\" (MVF) - identifying the exact point where funnels stop converting prospects into buyers.\n\nYehonatan operates under significant time constraints due to military service, which drives his preference for ruthless efficiency and direct execution over theoretical discussions. He has established himself as a \"ruthless copy chief\" with expertise in conversion optimization, customer journey mapping, and strategic pricing for the Israeli market. His communication style is notably direct and no-nonsense, preferring Hebrew and English while explicitly rejecting fluff or unnecessary pleasantries.\n\n**Current state**\n\nYehonatan is actively executing his first major client project with Tomer Fridman, a premium fitness and nutrition coach with extensive clinical experience. This project involves reviving dormant leads through a strategic email marketing campaign, with the goal of significantly increasing lead generation from current low numbers to much higher targets. The engagement includes creating segmented email sequences and implementing them through marketing automation platforms.\n\nHe has successfully executed cold outreach campaigns targeting Israeli fitness coaches, using a sophisticated 5-step conditional free value approach that has generated positive responses and scheduled consultations. His outreach strategy emphasizes moving prospects through a clear progression: replies \u2192 conversations \u2192 calls \u2192 revenue.\n\n**On the horizon**\n\nYehonatan is developing advanced funnel systems including quiz-based lead qualification mechanisms that automatically route prospects to appropriate service offerings based on their goals, support preferences, and urgency levels. These systems are designed to solve common conversion problems like visitor confusion from multiple service options and lack of effective lead capture.\n\nHe's also working on expanding his branded content strategy through social media, particularly Instagram posts and stories that reinforce his \"Revenue Leak\" positioning and Signal Lab brand identity.\n\n**Key learnings & principles**\n\nYehonatan has developed a clear philosophy around overdelivering through quality rather than quantity, rejecting approaches that add volume without strategic value. He emphasizes the importance of understanding complete customer journeys before executing tactical elements, requiring strategic thinking about the entire conversion process rather than isolated campaign components.\n\nHis approach prioritizes concrete outcomes and measurable results, with a strong focus on ROI calculations and pricing strategies that lower entry barriers while maintaining upsell opportunities. He has learned to structure engagements with discovery projects that prove value before larger commitments.\n\n**Approach & patterns**\n\nYehonatan operates with a systematic approach to client work, emphasizing thorough preparation and strategic analysis before execution. He prefers tactical \"battle card\" formats for sales preparation, prioritizing objection handling and pricing strategies over general overviews.\n\nHis workflow involves detailed briefing processes when collaborating with AI assistants, providing comprehensive context while maintaining control over task execution. He consistently requests informational summaries rather than directive instructions, preferring to receive strategic input while making his own tactical decisions.\n\nFor brand consistency, he maintains strict visual standards including specific color schemes and design requirements, with a strong preference for using established tools like Canva over code-based solutions.\n\n**Tools & resources**\n\nYehonatan works with marketing automation platforms including ActiveCampaign for comprehensive campaign management, and has experience with Rav-Messer platform for email implementation. He uses Canva for visual content creation, maintaining Signal Lab's brand aesthetic with dark backgrounds (#0a0a0a) and cyan accents (#00D9FF).\n\nHis tech stack includes various marketing training programs as background knowledge, and he leverages AI assistants for strategic analysis and content development while maintaining clear boundaries around execution control and deliverable formats.", "019c3384-5a5b-77c8-b1b6-a559342cbedf": "**Purpose & context**\n\nYehonatan is a copywriter and direct response marketing strategist working with clients to develop comprehensive marketing funnels. His primary focus is on creating email marketing campaigns, lead generation quizzes, and conversion optimization for service-based businesses. He works closely with Tomer Friedman, a clinical dietitian with 22+ years of experience, developing marketing materials for Tomer's Nutrition & Training (N&T) program that targets busy successful men aged 35-50 (doctors, pilots, hi-tech executives, business owners earning 30-50k NIS monthly). The program combines 20-25 minute workouts three times per week with flexible nutrition designed around existing lifestyle patterns like restaurant meals, conferences, and business travel.\n\nYehonatan also operates a pet store website project called \"\u05d4\u05d7\u05d9 \u05d5\u05d4\u05e6\u05d5\u05de\u05d7\" (The Living and the Plant) in Dimona, working to integrate plant catalog data into the nursery section. Success is measured through conversion metrics like consultation bookings, quiz completions, and email engagement rates, with realistic expectations of 15-25% open rates, 3-5% click rates, and 1-3% consultation bookings from cold leads.\n\n**Current state**\n\nYehonatan recently completed a major strategic pivot for Tomer's campaign, rewriting an entire six-email revival sequence and VSL outline to shift from nutrition-only positioning to the combined N&T approach. This involved completely restructuring messaging, subject lines, and strategic positioning rather than making minor tweaks. He's now working on updating the diagnostic quiz to reflect this same N&T product positioning while preserving the existing technical framework and quiz structure.\n\nThe campaign targets a lead list of approximately 1,400 contacts with mixed demographics, requiring a \"busy people\" approach rather than the originally planned male-specific segmentation. Yehonatan is managing expectations around A/B testing limitations with small sample sizes and setting realistic conversion benchmarks for the client.\n\n**Key learnings & principles**\n\nYehonatan has learned that product positioning changes require complete campaign rewrites rather than surface-level modifications. When clients pivot their core offering (like moving from nutrition-only to N&T), all marketing materials need fundamental restructuring to maintain message consistency. He's discovered the importance of setting realistic performance expectations with clients, particularly around email marketing metrics and the statistical limitations of small-scale A/B testing.\n\nHe's also learned to be very specific about modification requests - when working with finalized documents, he prefers minimal, precise changes rather than broader improvements that weren't explicitly requested. The principle of \"change nothing except X\" has emerged as important for maintaining client trust and avoiding unnecessary revisions.\n\n**Approach & patterns**\n\nYehonatan works systematically through marketing funnel development, starting with lead magnets (diagnostic quizzes), moving through email sequences, and incorporating video content (VSLs) for enhanced engagement. He prefers working through updates \"one or two messages at a time\" rather than receiving everything at once, allowing for iterative refinement.\n\nHis debugging approach involves thorough analysis of technical issues, particularly with HTML/JavaScript quiz functionality, examining scoring logic, visual feedback systems, and user experience flow. He collaborates with AI tools for both strategic guidance and technical implementation, clearly defining roles and responsibilities in multi-tool workflows.\n\n**Tools & resources**\n\nYehonatan uses Thunderbit for web scraping and data collection, Lovable platform for website development, and works with Excel files for data analysis and transfer. He regularly works with HTML/CSS/JavaScript for quiz development and landing page creation, and utilizes Google Docs for collaborative content development. His technical toolkit includes bash commands for file manipulation and debugging, with specific expertise in Hebrew RTL layout implementation and conversion tracking systems."}, "account_uuid": "9c6348ea-fc86-46fc-9b0c-5bfa6d8b8ba7"}]
